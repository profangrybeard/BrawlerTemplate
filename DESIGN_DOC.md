# Design Document

Fill this out as a team. This is your plan — update it as your game evolves.

---

## Game Identity

- **Game Name:**
- **Tagline** (one sentence pitch):
- **Art Style / Visual Direction:**

## Game Rules

The template ships with default rules. Keep them, modify them, or replace them entirely.

### Win Condition
> Template default: Ring-out via blast zones (knock opponent off the arena).

Your game:

### Health / Damage Model
> Template default: HP bars with knockback scaling — lower health means more knockback taken. Formula: `knockback = base * (2 - healthPercent)`.

Your game:

### Match Format
> Template default: Best of 3 rounds. Single KO ends a round.

Your game:

### Time Limit
> Template default: No time limit.

Your game:

### Unique Mechanics
What makes your game different? (Examples: meter/super system, environmental hazards, status effects, stance switching, items)

## Fighters

### Fighter 1

- **Archetype** (speed / power / range / grappler / etc.):
- **Unique Mechanic:**
- **Visual Description:**
- **Key Attacks:**

### Fighter 2

## Team Plan

There are no role restrictions. Organize however works best for your team.

- **Tech Lead** (repo owner):
- **How are you dividing the work?**

---

## Technical Decisions

- Using default `FighterMovement` or bringing your own?
- Modifying any shared systems (`_Shared/`)? If so, who owns that work?
- Any custom mechanics that need new scripts beyond the template?

## Milestones

| Week | Goal |
|------|------|
